                <div>
                    <p>Hair Day was born from Pria’s passion for colorful,
                        creative hair and Garry’s talent for cutting and
                        styling. After earning her colorist certificate, Pria
                        dreamed of a salon where clients could “treat
                        themselves” to something special.</p>
                    <p>She teamed up with Garry, her longtime friend, to open
                        Hair Day in Madison. Our tight-knit crew of seven—two
                        stylists, three colorists, one manicurist, and one
                        make-up artist—works together to bring you standout
                        looks in a fun, relaxed setting. We love sharing our
                        skills, whether it’s through a bold dye job or online
                        tutorials to keep you glowing between appointments!</p>
