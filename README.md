## Overview

This is the first project of the **Coursera Meta Frontend Web Developer Certification**. The project, **Hair Day**, is a responsive single-page website for a fictional salon located in Madison, Wisconsin. It showcases a clean design with a focus on HTML and CSS skills, including animations, hover effects. The website promotes the salon's services, such as haircuts, coloring, styling, makeup, and nail care, while providing an "About Us" section and a contact form for user inquiries.

The styling is implemented using custom CSS with a consistent color scheme, smooth transitions, and keyframe animations to enhance the user experience. This project demonstrates foundational frontend development skills learned in the certification program.

## Features

- **Animations**: Includes slide-in and hover effects for a dynamic feel (e.g., `slideInFromLeft`, `slideInFromRight`, `SlideUp`, `UpToDown`).
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects on navigation links, buttons, images, and form inputs for improved interactivity.
- **Structured Layout**: Organized into sections (Header, Main Content, About, Services, Contact, Footer) with semantic HTML.
- **Custom Styling**: Uses a cohesive color palette (`#fee0d4`, `#d0604c`) and the 'Trebuchet MS' font family.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic structure and content.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsiveness.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the live demo.
